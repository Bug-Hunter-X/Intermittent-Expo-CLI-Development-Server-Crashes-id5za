# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes intermittently without providing clear error messages in the terminal. The crash often occurs after modifying the codebase, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
The Expo development server unexpectedly terminates without any error messages displayed on the console.  This behavior is inconsistent, occurring randomly after seemingly minor changes to the project's code.  The issue is particularly prevalent when working with more complex components or advanced state management techniques.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Make several minor code changes to the components.
5. Observe that the development server may crash at various points during development.

## Solution
The underlying cause of this intermittent crash could stem from several factors such as memory leaks, unhandled exceptions within dependent libraries, or even issues with the Expo CLI itself.  The provided solution focuses on improving the application's error handling and ensuring better component management to mitigate such instances.

### Additional Debugging Tips
* **Check your system resources:** Make sure your system is not low on memory or CPU resources.
* **Review your dependencies:** Update packages to their latest versions and ensure compatibility among them.
* **Monitor CPU and memory usage:** Use a system monitor to check for any unusual spikes in resource consumption when the crashes occur.
